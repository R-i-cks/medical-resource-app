# PLN-TP2 — Medical Resource App

This repository contains a **Medical Resource application** that aggregates medical entries scraped from multiple sources and written in different languages.

The application is capable of:
- Storing and managing medical resources from heterogeneous sources  
- Automatically translating content between languages  
- Dynamically rendering **language-specific pages** for each medical entry on demand  

In addition, the project integrates a **question-answering (QA) language model** designed to answer queries based on the available medical resources.  
⚠️ *Note:* The QA model is not available in the current demo version.
